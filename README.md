## About
### Why?
MarketXIV was created due to a lack of command line tools for getting market data from any FFXIV API. The command line is always super light-weight to keep open and fast to use, making it perfect for getting the necessary information about the market in a short amount of time.

### Features
- ðŸ”¥ Super Fast Responses: Get the information you need in a split second
- ðŸ”§ Built-in Updater: All executable updates are handled for you, always use the best.
- ðŸ“¦ Lightweight: Uses hardly any system storage or resources.
- âš¡ Powerful: Can fetch all the information you'd ever need.

## Installing
### Go Install
install Go on your system and then run the following command, which will install MarketXIV to wherever your GoPath binaries folder is located.
```
go install github.com/BitsOfAByte/marketxiv@latest 
```

When using Go to install the app certain build-time flags will not be set which may cause the application to say there is an update available. Running the update command after installing via Go is recommended. 

### GitHub Release
Download the [newest release](https://github.com/BitsOfAByte/MarketXIV/releases/latest) and extract it somewhere inside of your system path, or alternatively add the executable to your path wherever you'd like it to be installed. [(Windows Path Guide)](https://www.maketecheasier.com/what-is-the-windows-path/) [(UNIX Path Guide)](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001647.htm)

If you are confused about what architecture to download, then you will most likely want `amd64` on Windows/Intel-Processor Macs/Linux, `arm64` on new M-Processor Macs and `arm` on RasberryPi. The updater tool will download for your architecture once installed. 

*Some devices may use different architectures that are not listed here, it is best to check your processor info to confirm what you need to download*

### Manual (Source)
If you would like to build MarketXIV from source, install both Go & GoReleaser on to your system, then run the one-liner below:
```
git clone https://github.com/BitsOfAByte/MarketXIV && cd MarketXIV && goreleaser build --single-target --rm-dist --snapshot
```
You will find the compiled binary for your OS & Arch inside of the /dist folder. Please keep in mind building manually will create a snapshot version instead of a full release, but you can still update as usual.
