## About
### Why?
MarketXIV was created due to a lack of command line tools for getting market data from any FFXIV API. The command line is always super light-weight to keep open and fast to use, making it perfect for getting the necessary information about the market in a short amount of time.

### Features
- ðŸ”¥ Super Fast Responses: Get the information you need in a split second
- ðŸ”§ Built-in Updater: All executable updates are handled for you, always use the best.
- ðŸ“¦ Lightweight: Uses hardly any system storage or resources.
- âš¡ Powerful: Can fetch all the information you'd ever need.

## Installing
### Go Install
install Go on your system and then run the following command, which will install MarketXIV to wherever your GoPath binaries folder is located.
```
go install github.com/BitsOfAByte/marketxiv@latest
```
