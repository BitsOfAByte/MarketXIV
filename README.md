## About
### Why?
MarketXIV was created due to a lack of command line tools for getting market data from any FFXIV API. The command line is always super light-weight to keep open and fast to use, making it perfect for getting the necessary information about the market in a short amount of time.

### Features
- ðŸ”¥ Super Fast Responses: Get the information you need in a split second
- ðŸ”§ Built-in Updater: All executable updates are handled for you
- ðŸ“¦ Lightweight: Uses hardly any system storage or resources.
- âš¡ Powerful: Can fetch all the information you'd ever need.

## Installing
### Using Scoop (Windows)
Install [scoop](https://scoop.sh/) and then run the following commands in a non-escalated command prompt:
```
scoop bucket add marketxiv https://github.com/BitsOfAByte/MarketXIV.git
scoop install marketxiv/marketxiv
```

### Using Homebrew (MacOS & Linux)
Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on your system and then run the following:
```
brew tap bitsofabyte/marketxiv https://github.com/BitsOfAByte/MarketXIV.git
brew install marketxiv
```

### GitHub Releases (All Platforms)
Download the [newest release](https://github.com/BitsOfAByte/MarketXIV/releases/latest) and extract it somewhere inside of your system path, or add the executable to your PATH instead. [(Windows Path Guide)](https://www.maketecheasier.com/what-is-the-windows-path/) [(UNIX Path Guide)](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001647.htm). 

Refer to your processors documentation for the architecture you need to download.

### From Source (All Platforms)
If you would like to build MarketXIV from source, install both GoLang & GoReleaser on to your system and then run the one-liner below:
```
git clone https://github.com/BitsOfAByte/MarketXIV && cd MarketXIV && SUPABASE_KEY="none" goreleaser build --single-target --rm-dist --snapshot
```
You will find the compiled binary for your OS & Arch inside of the `/dist` folder,

## Analytics / Logs
